# Project Setup Instructions

This project consists of a frontend built with Svelte and Tailwind CSS, and a backend responsible for serving data to the frontend. The frontend has two pages: the **Product Listing Page**, which displays a list of products, and the **Product Description Page**, which shows detailed information about a selected product.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js (v14 or later), npm (Node Package Manager), and Tailwind CSS (already set up within the project) installed on your machine.
